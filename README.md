Various Java programs I worked on while learning the language.

PlayingCards: 
An object oriented excercise to model a deck of cards using object oriented methodology. The deck of cards is then used to play several card games, War and GoFish.

Tournament_SC2_V3:
This program models the stages of a game tournament, including storing and retrieving a list of players from a file, running a group stage and elimination bracket, and using player weighting and random numbers to determine match results.
